  <div>
    <h1>My wonderful family</h1>
    <p>I live in a house near the lake. I have three brothers and one sister, and I was born last. 
        My father was a business money, and my mother is a nurse at a big hospital. 
        
        My brothers are very smart and work hard in school. My sister is a nervous girl, 
        but she is very kind. My grandmother also lives with us. She came from Rwanda when I was two years old. 
        She has grown old, but she is still very strong. She cooks the best food!!!!
        
        My family is very important to me. We do lots of things together. 
        My brothers and I like to go on long walks in the lake. 
        My sister likes to cook with my grandmother. On the weekends we all play board games together. 
        We laugh and always have a good time.
         I love my family very much,but by now am not leaving with my family they are in Kenya and am in Uganda for my studies...am building my future life in school.<
